Thank you', 'output': 'Hi;welcome to Chat Doctor The cause of your abdominal pain above the pubic region can be due to infection in pelvic region;may be due to bulky uterus;infection of intestine that is lower bowel/rectum but as the pain gets relieved it could be due to census if the pain comes and goes on its own after some time and is better after passing stools or gas. This sort of pain if you have it could be due to infection of intestine for which you need to take antibiotics. The bulky uterus can be as a result of MA, but there can be other reasons that need to be examined, so please consult a Gynecologist for examination and treatment. Thanks'}\\n\"\n",
